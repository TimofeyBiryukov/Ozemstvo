# Ozemstvo

Ozemstvo is a simple utility that allows you to configure rules for opening URLs in specific browsers. You can define rules that specify which browser to use for a particular URL or URL pattern, and Ozemstvo will automatically open the URL in the appropriate browser according to your rules. For example, you can set a rule to open all YouTube URLs in Firefox, or to open all Microsoft.com URLs in Edge. Ozemstvo uses the registry to find the installed browsers on your system, so you can use it with any browser that is registered on your machine.
